# üè† House Sales Analysis & Forecasting

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science workflow on a housing sales dataset. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualization, and time-series forecasting using the Holt-Winters method.

## üìÇ Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
  - Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
  - Converted date fields to datetime  
  - Created derived features:
    - `total_area` (living + basement + other areas)  
    - `property_age` (current year - build year)  
    - `price_per_sqft` (price √∑ living area)  
    - `is_renovated` (binary flag from renovation year)  
  - Outlier detection and treatment using **IQR** and **Z-score** methods  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Distribution of property prices and living space  
  - Sales patterns by decade of construction  
  - Renovation impact on pricing  
  - Correlation between grade, area, and price  
  - Geographical spread of high-value properties  

- **Visualization**
  - Histograms and boxplots for key features  
  - Trend analysis across decades  
  - Location-based scatter plots  
  - Price vs. grade and area visualizations  

- **Time Series Forecasting**
  - Aggregated sales by month  
  - Applied Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing  
  - Modeled **trend + seasonality** in sales  
  - Forecasted sales for the **next 6 months**  
  - Visualization confirms alignment with historical patterns

## üìä Key Insights
- Renovated properties consistently achieve higher sales values.  
- Houses built in recent decades show rising price trends compared to older stock.  
- Strong positive correlation between `sqft_living` and price ‚Äî larger homes command significantly higher value.  
- Seasonal sales fluctuations suggest demand peaks during certain months.  
- Holt-Winters forecasting projects steady growth with periodic seasonal effects.

## ‚úÖ Overall Conclusion
This project delivers a **robust analytical pipeline**:
- From raw housing data ‚Üí cleaned & feature-engineered dataset  
- From exploratory insights ‚Üí actionable patterns in pricing & renovation trends  
- From forecasting ‚Üí reliable short-term projections for sales planning  

The approach equips stakeholders with **data-driven decision support** for:
- Pricing strategy  
- Inventory and budget planning  
- Marketing timing  
- Long-term investment decisions
